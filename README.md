MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification
This project demonstrates a basic machine learning pipeline for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Python.

📘 Overview
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), each of size 28x28 pixels. This notebook walks through:

Loading and preprocessing the MNIST data

Building a neural network model

Training and evaluating the model

Visualizing predictions and results

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy & Matplotlib

📊 Sample Output
Training accuracy and loss graphs

Final test accuracy

Digit predictions with visualization

✅ Results
Achieved an accuracy of ~98% on the test set using a simple dense neural network.
